## Emmet

Built into *VS Code* is a plugin that helps you write **HTML and CSS more efficiently** by providing a bunch of clever **shortcuts**. 

**Emmet** does not have that big of a learning curve, and if you already know how to write HTML and CSS you’ll have no trouble picking up Emmet abbreviations.

Most text editors allow to store and re-use commonly used code chunks, called *“snippets”*. While *snippets* are a good way to **boost your productivity**, all implementations have common pitfalls: you have to define the snippet first and you can’t extend them in runtime.
