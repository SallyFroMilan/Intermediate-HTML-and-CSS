## Useful little CSS features you can use to add some shine to your projects.
There are a lot of CSS properties, *hundreds*. Luckily, you don’t have to memorize them all: the amount of properties you’re actually going to use on a daily basis is much smaller.

## Background
The background property not only sets background colors but is actually a shorthand for 8 different background-related properties:
<ul>
<li>specify background images</li>
<li>change the position of background images</li>
<li>change the size of background images</li>
<li>change how background images repeat<li>
<li>or tile if they are too small to fill their container</li>
<li>have multiple background layers</li>
</ul>

One thing to note is that it is possible to use these properties **individually**, and in some cases it might be *easier and more clear* to do that than defaulting to the shorthand. This is in contrast to some other shorthand properties where it is almost always preferable to default to using the shorthand (flex, margin, padding etc.).
