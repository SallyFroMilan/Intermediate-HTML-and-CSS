## Useful CSS properties that can be used when working with text.

### The system font stack
If you use the `font-family` property to change font and those fonts you are looking for do not happen to be installed on your user’s computer, then a **fallback font** will be displayed. If you have not defined a fallback, then the default HTML font will be used, which is often somewhat ugly. For this reason, it’s common to see somewhat long stacks of fonts listed on projects.
