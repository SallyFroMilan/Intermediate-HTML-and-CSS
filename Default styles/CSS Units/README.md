## CSS Units
There are many different units that you can use to **define sizes in CSS**.

### Absolute units
are those that are *always the same* in any context. `px` is an absolute unit because *the size of a pixel doesnâ€™t change* relative to anything else on the page. In fact, `px` **is the only absolute unit you should be using for web projects**. The rest of them make more sense in a print setting because they are related to physical units such as `in` (inch) and `cm` (centimeter).

### Relative units
are units that *can change* based on their context. There are several of them that you are likely to encounter and want to use.
