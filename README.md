# INERMEDIATE HTML and CSS

This is the first of the **two part course** where we are going to dig *deeper* into **HTML** and **CSS**.

Thanks to the previous **foundations** lessons we gave you the bare necessities for getting started so you could move on and be somewhat productive as quickly as possible, but now it’s time to slow down and dig in!

There are many more **HTML elements**!<br>
Throughout this course, we’ll be hitting the rest of the important elements such as *forms and tables*.<br>
There is also a lot more that you can do with **CSS** that you’ll learn throughout this course, such as *variables, functions, shadows* and of course *grid layouts*!

You’ll learn about *animations, accessibility, and responsive design* in the second part of this course later in the curriculum.
