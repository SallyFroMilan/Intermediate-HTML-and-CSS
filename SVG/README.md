## SVG - Scalable Vector Graphics

A very common **image format** on the web, an *incredibly powerful tool* for creating **high-quality, dynamic images** for your website.


### What are SVGs?

A ***scalable*** **image format**, which means they will: 

- **easily scale to any size**
- **retain their quality without increasing their filesize**

and are also very useful if you need to:

- **create or modify your images programmatically** - as you can change their properties through CSS and JavaScript.

**SVGs** are often used for:

1. Icons
2. Graphs/Charts
3. Large, simple images
4. Patterned backgrounds
5. Applying effects to other elements via SVG filters

“**SVG**” stands for “**Scalable Vector Graphics**”.
 
° **Vector graphics** are images defined by *math*<br>
as opposed to traditional<br> 
° “raster graphics” where your image is defined by a *grid of pixels*.

With raster graphics, the detail is *limited to the size of that pixel grid*.<br>
If you want to increase the size of the image (scale it), you have to increase the size of that grid.<br>
*How do you decide what all those new pixels should look like?* There’s no simple solution. Additionally, the larger the grid, the bigger your filesize grows.
