## SVG - Scalable Vector Graphics

A very common **image format** on the web, an *incredibly powerful tool* for creating **high-quality, dynamic images** for your website.


### What are SVGs?

A ***scalable*** **image format**, which means they will: 

- **easily scale to any size**
- **retain their quality without increasing their filesize**

and are also very useful if you need to:

- **create or modify your images programmatically** - as you can change their properties through CSS and JavaScript.
