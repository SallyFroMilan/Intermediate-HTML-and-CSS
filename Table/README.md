## HTML tables
allow you to create **two-dimensional tables made of rows and columns**. 

Some data just *really needs to be displayed* in a **table**. **HTML tables** might be *less commonly used* than buttons, links, lists and everything else you’ve learned so far, but there are **some cases where they’re the perfect tool**.

Some of the more advanced features can get a little tricky to set up correctly but getting started with tables is pretty easy. You create a table with `<table></table>` tags and then put the elements for rows, columns, headers, or anything else that’s possible inside those table elements.

## When should you NOT use HTML tables?

**HTML tables should be used for tabular data** — this is what they are designed for.<br> Unfortunately, a lot of people used to use HTML tables to lay out web pages, e.g. one row to contain the header, one row to contain the content columns, one row to contain the footer, etc. This was commonly used because CSS support across browsers used to be terrible; table layouts are much less common nowadays, but you might still see them in some corners of the web.
