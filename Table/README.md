## HTML Tables
allow you to create **two-dimensional tables made of rows and columns**. 

Some data just *really needs to be displayed* in a **table**. **HTML tables** might be *less commonly used* than buttons, links, lists and everything else you’ve learned so far, but there are **some cases where they’re the perfect tool**.

Some of the more advanced features can get a little tricky to set up correctly but getting started with tables is pretty easy. You create a table with `<table></table>` tags and then put the elements for rows, columns, headers, or anything else that’s possible inside those table elements.
